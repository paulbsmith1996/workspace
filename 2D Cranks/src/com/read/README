This file is to explain how to write a script for a crank system.

Each line of the script represents one crank, with all information, including
name length, speed, initial angle, color of trail left, and whether of not it
is being followed. Each line should be formatted as follows:

<name> l: <length> s: <speed> t: <initial angle / pi> c: <color> (f)

The <length>, <speed>, and <initial angle> attributes can be given in any
order, so long as they are formatted in the same manner and are all separated
by a space character. The <color> attribute must be specified last and the f
flag at the end an be place anywhere in the line, as long as it separated by a
space character from the text on each side. This presence or absence of this
flag determines whether or not the crank scripted by that specific line will
leave a breadcrumb trail of the specified color. 

A sample script for a crank system would resemble this:


rootcrank l: 150 s: 10 t: 0 c: white 
secondcrank l: 50 s: -30 t: 0 c: red f


(In fact, this crank system would draw an astroid curve)

The trailing end of the last crank will automatically be set to be followed
in BLACK. This means the characteristic curve of the crank system is always
traced in BLACK if you are using this method of scripting crank systems.

The root crank of the system is the first line of the script and all
subsequent cranks are children of the crank created by the preceding line in
the script.
